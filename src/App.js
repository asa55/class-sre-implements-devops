          <strong>Dev:</strong> this category writes new code to deliver new
          features on behalf of the product team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ops:</strong> this category deploys the code on the IT
          backbone, delivering dev's product with high uptime and availability
          to customer(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, devs and ops had a contentious relationship. Devs{" "}
          <em>(with limited knowledge of ops-related-challenges)</em> would
          throw new code over the metaphorical wall to ops{" "}
          <em>(with limited knowledge of code quirks)</em>.

          <strong>DevOps:</strong> this came along to resolve five key issues:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Reducing silos by breaking down barriers across teams improves
              collaboration and throughput
            </li>
            <li>
              Accepting failure as normal recognizes that both humans and
              computers are imperfect. Accepting and quantifying error isn't
              just realistic - we'll see its practical application shortly as a
              key to DevOps success
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing gradual changes eases code review and rollback (in
              the event of bugs)
            </li>
            <li>
              Leveraging tooling and automation minimizes toil (defined shortly)
              and enables engineering's responsibilities to grow without
              linearly scaling the workload
            </li>
            <li>
              Measuring everything is critical. Outcomes (including items 1 - 4
              above) can't be assessed unless and until they are measured
            </li>
          </ol>

        <p>
          At <strong>Google</strong>, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) has
          specific meaning. In a sense, it is one way of carrying out DevOps
          (which is why they coined the term
          <code>
            <br />
            class <span className="rainbow-text-animated">
              SRE
            </span> implements{" "}
            <span className="rainbow-text-animated">DevOps</span>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's how SRE makes DevOps happen:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>To Reduce Organization Silos:</strong> Devs share
              ownership of production and use the same tooling (to encourage a
              shared perspective)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To Accept Failure as Normal:</strong> Acceptable rates for
              going out of spec are encoded in error budgets, and blameless
              postmortems to ensure the same failures in production systems
              don't happen more than once
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To Implement Gradual Change:</strong> Canary deployments
              (changes are released to a small percentage of the total user base
              before rolling out to all users)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To Leverage Tooling and Automation:</strong> Manual "toil"
              is reduced or eliminated by spending time automating this year's
              job away
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To Measure Everything:</strong> Measuring "toil", system
              reliability, and system health are critical metrics for successful
              SRE
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </Paper>
      <Paper className="paper-class" elevation={paperHeight}>
        <h3>Topic 2: SLIs, SLOs & SRAs</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Wouldn't it be nice if we could:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All use consistent definitions for "reliability" and
              "availability"
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep devs from breaking more and more things with frequent code
              pushes
            </li>
            <li>
              Get product teams (and hence devs) to agree reliability is a
              pressing issue
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          This is the classic DevOps problem statement, and is exactly the
          challenge Google set out to solve by refining its SRE program in the
          early 2000's.
          <br />
          The foundation of SRE is simple: define availability, specify an
          acceptable level of availability, and come up with a plan in case of
          failure. We'll dig into the specifics in a moment, but by
          communicating this information across the entire organization (from
          individual contributors all the way up to VPs). This builds a shared
          sense of responsibility and know what to do (and when to do it) if the
          team needs to slow down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wait, shouldn't we strive for 0% errors and üíØ% availability? ü§î
          <br />‚ùå NO! (
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEylFyxbDLE&list=PLIivdWyY5sqJrKl7D2u-gmis8h9K66qoj&index=2&t=2m17s">
            <strong>click here to see what Google thinks</strong>
          </a>
          )
          <br />
          100% availability isn't a real target. Let's dig into how quantifying
          and leveraging real risk and error rates can meaningfully inform our
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google loves the phrase{" "}
          <code>"By doing X, I accomplished Y, as measured by Z"</code>
          <br />
          This thematically resonates with the terminology we're about to learn
          for SLI (specific pass/fail metrics over a short amount of time), SLOs
          (SLIs integrated over time), and SLAs (written agreements with a
          customer based on meeting or failing SLO commitments).

          <strong>Remember:</strong> by defining shared vocabulary across all
          levels of the organization, we're breaking down silos (the first
          pillar of DevOps üéâ). SLIs give technical teams clear objectives, SLOs
          translate them to scales meaningful to product teams (who can provide
          stakeholder feedback), and SLAs translate them to business-level
          objectives (most importantly, ones customers care about).
